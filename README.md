# **ReSharper <3 Nancy!**

**Nancy plugin for ReSharper** adds navigation and intellisense support for [Nancy](http://nancyfx.org/) in [ReSharper](http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/), for super-duper-happy-path web development!

## What does it do?

The plugin adds support for the different view engines supported by Nancy! This includes features like:

- Special syntax highlighting for view pages

- Navigation to and from the view page to the Nancy module (using Go to Declaration or Ctrl-Click)  

- Creating views directly from usage (Alt-Enter)

- Supports [`SuperSimpleViewEngine`](https://github.com/NancyFx/Nancy/wiki/The-Super-Simple-View-Engine) and `Razor` views
