# **ReSharper <3 Nancy!**

**Nancy plugin for ReSharper** adds navigation and intellisense support for [Nancy](http://nancyfx.org/) in [ReSharper](http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/), for super-duper-happy-path web development!

## What does it do?

The plugin adds support for the different view engines supported by Nancy! This includes features like:

- Creating views directly from usage
